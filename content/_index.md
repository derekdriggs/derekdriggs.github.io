I'm **Derek Driggs**, a researcher in machine learning and optimization.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Cambridge Centre for Analysis at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Prof. Carola-Bibiane Sch&ouml;nlieb].

I am grateful to be a [Gates Cambridge scholar] and a member of the [CCIMI].

<!--My [research] is in developing optimization algorithms for machine learning and image processing applications.-->


<!-- Since March 2020, I have been a founding member of the [AIX-COVNET collaboration], an international group of researchers investigating the use of machine learning models to aid clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check out our recently released [papers]. -->
