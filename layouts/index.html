          <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
          <h4>I am interested in machine learning algorithms for imaging processing. Most of my research is in creating optimization algorithms to solve large-scale machine learning and imaging problems efficiently.</h4>
          <!-- <br> -->
          <h4>In my most recent projects, I have been developing machine learning algorithms to help clinicians interpret radiographs. I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between academic models and models that can be safely deployed in the clinic.</h4>
          <!-- <br> -->
          <h4>In March 2020, our research group helped found the <a href="https://covid19ai.maths.cam.ac.uk/home">AIX-COVNET collaboration</a>, an international group of researchers developing machine learning models to aid clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check out our recently released <a href="https://gohugo.io/">papers</a>.</h4>
